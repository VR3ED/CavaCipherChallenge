# CavaCipherChallenge
 this program is a small c# sharp quiz. It was supposed to be used as funny christmas gift among my family but i programmed it to get the answers to both second and 3rd question dinamically. So if you wanna change the first question and the constant "amazonKey" you can get your own custom experience with this small quiz.
